I build this thing and it was awesome

Then fill in the values where `theta-length` is in degrees

```html
<a-curvedimage
  src="#panorama"
  height="4.0"
  radius="3.64637"
  theta-length="360"
></a-curvedimage>
```

Then for final touch ups, I made sure to position the user to the centre of the curved image and limit the user to only be able to look around.

Because of the way panoramas work, the experience I built is less impressive when you can see the top and bottom edge.

> It is a better experience when you rotate your phone horizontally to align with the image
